## Inspiration
According to [_The Journal_](https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/06/02/survey-teachers-feeling-stressed-anxious-overwhelmed-and-capable.aspx), **more than 94%** of the teachers have transitioned to remote teaching, but there has been a **lack of improvements** in tools to support remote teaching.

Dude to this lack of tools and technologies in the educational field, teachers have been struggling to cover the necessary amount of curriculum within a year and expressing frustrations faced by the harsh situation:
- ["I am feeling overwhelmed with vast amount of ideas and resources available." ](https://ditchthattextbook.com/dear-teacher-overwhelmed-by-technology/)
- ["I don’t have much experience, and I’m learning things all over again,” ](https://berkeleyhighjacket.com/2020/features/educators-feel-overwhelmed-by-the-increased-workload-of-distance-learning/) 
- [“I didn’t grow up with computers. Back then, we had typewriters, maybe an electric typewriter, and now they no longer exist,” ](https://berkeleyhighjacket.com/2020/features/educators-feel-overwhelmed-by-the-increased-workload-of-distance-learning/)

## What it does
The web app [Professor's Pet](https://github.com/lanpai/ProfessorsPet) is a tool that simplifies teacher’s tasks and reduces the overwhelming responsibilities of managing various remote learning platforms like Zoom and  Google Classroom by integrating them into a single master platform. This will provide the teachers to have a single user-friendly website that not only prevents unnecssary hoppings around different websites but also allows to execute daily tasks with automation and visualizations, such as attendance, announcements, and invitations to a meeting.

## How I built it ##
Our team integrated [Zoom API](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api) with OAuth and [Google Classroom API](https://developers.google.com/classroom). For backend, we utilized node.js, express.js, nginx on unix server. For frontend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used.

## Challenges I ran into
One of the biggest struggles we faced as a team was that Zoom only allows API requests from a server, so all the team members had to code and debug in the production environment. This made the debugging process much slower than working individually in a development environment, but we were able to maximize our productivity with active communications through discord, live group call, version control system.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of 
We are proud of the seamless collaboration despite working in production environment and most importantly our logo!



---
## What I learned
While researching and testing our code with remote teaching platforms, we were able to approach the problems of online school in perspective of the teachers.

## What's next for Professor's Pet
After the hackathon, we are hoping to implement more automated Zoom functions like creating and assigning students to breakout rooms, and saving chat to keep track of activities of each student during the meeting.
